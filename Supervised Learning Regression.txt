Supervised Learning Regression

Project Overview

This project focuses on applying Machine Learning techniques to solve a specific problem using a structured workflow. The analysis and model building were conducted in Jupyter Notebook.

Dataset

Name: 5G-Energy Consumption

Source: International Telecommunication Union (ITU)

Description: This dataset was provided by the ITU in 2023 as part of a global challenge or competition for data scientists worldwide to solve the 5G energy consumption modeling problem using machine learning techniques.

Size: [Mention number of rows and columns]

Objective

The objective is to build and train a ML model to estimate the energy consumed by different 5G base stations, taking into consideration the impact of various engineering configurations, traffic conditions, and energy-saving methods.

Model Evaluation Interpretation

The model's performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.87 indicates that, on average, the model’s predictions deviate by approximately 3.87 units from the actual energy consumption values, suggesting relatively small errors. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 27.64 reflects the average squared differences between predicted and actual values, where lower values indicate fewer large deviations. Since MSE is in squared units, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 5.26 provides a more interpretable measure, showing that the model’s predictions, on average, deviate by 5.26 units from the actual values.

The R² score of 0.8544 indicates that the model explains approximately 85.44% of the variance in energy consumption, demonstrating strong predictive power. A value closer to 1 suggests that the model effectively captures patterns in the data, while a lower R² would indicate poor explanatory ability.

Overall, the model is performing well, as reflected by its relatively low error values and high R² score. To further improve performance, potential next steps include refining feature engineering, conducting additional hyperparameter tuning, or exploring ensemble modeling techniques.
